# D-SHIELD

Distributed Spacecraft with Heuristic Intelligence to Enable Logistical Decisions (D-SHIELD) is a suite of scalable software methods and frameworks 
to helps schedule payload operations of a large constellation, with multiple payloads per and across spacecraft, such that the collection of observational
data and their downlink, constrained by the constellation constraints (orbital mechanics), resources (e.g., power) and subsystems (e.g., attitude control), 
results in maximum science value for a selected use case. Constellation topology, spacecraft and ground network characteristics can be imported 
from design tools or existing constellations. The framework includes a science simulator to inform the scheduler of the predictive value of observations or operational decisions.
